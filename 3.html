   <p>The first birth begins with the design of Brandon Ike in 10 days. It was originally called Mocha, but after 4 months it was renamed LiveScript and after 3 months it became JavaScript, which continues to this day. Even though the syntax is similar to Java, the name was named JavaScript ... and the inside was intentionally made to bury the famous Java. [3]

        JS was originally designed as a high-level abstraction language for building applications on Netscape servers and was included in the navigator under the name LiveScript. However, JS was unreasonable abstraction at the time. There were many performance problems because I tried [4] . In addition, JS, which I gave the name to do some marketing, felt like a hotplate of Java, so it was ignored by developers at the time.
