   <p>In the past, it was common to write design elements in HTML . In other words, by putting all kinds of layout and design information into HTML, it became a document for design, not a structured document, which is the original purpose of HTML. Because the <table> tag, which requires the creation of a <table> is used to compose the layout, it is difficult for even an expert to know what this document is from the HTML source code. [2]

        Accordingly, in W3C , "Let's create a structured HTML by completely separating design elements from HTML!" For the purpose of releasing CSS. Accordingly, it is recommended not to use all elements related to design in HTML, such as bgcolor . Since the announcement of CSS, new tags such as div, span, and section have been introduced to help structuring HTML documents, and style tags such as strike and font have been converted to non-recommended tags, and have been deleted in HTML5 . Table is recommended only for the purpose of expressing tabular data, and thead and tbody tags have been introduced to help the structuring of the table.
